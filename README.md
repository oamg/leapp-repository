# How to write actors

See the tutorial for [creating the first actor](https://leapp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/first-actor.html).

# How to write actor tests

Please read documentation about [how to unit test actors](https://leapp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/unit-testing.html).

# How to install dependencies, run tests & execute actors

## Installing actor dependencies

Each actor can now have its own Makefile with the `install-deps` target. This
takes care of installing any dependencies of your actor. If your actor has
any dependencies, include them in the Makefile.

See the testing actor's example [here](repos/common/actors/testactor/Makefile).

To install dependencies for all actors, run:

``` bash
$ make install-deps
```

## Running tests locally

To run all tests from leapp-actors, run the following code from
the `leapp-actors` directory:

``` bash
$ make test
```

It is also possible to generate a report in a JUnit XML format:

``` bash
$ make test REPORT=report.xml
```

## Registering Leapp repositories and executing actors

When you want to execute actor with

``` bash
$ snactor run my_actor
```

or run discover feature

``` bash
$ snactor discover
```

it is good idea to register everything in `repos` to avoid possible errors
with parsing repository metadata (**NOTE:** these errors can be sometimes
cryptic, but may look like: `missing attribute name in .leapp/info`, etc.)

```bash
$ make register
```
where `register` target will run `snactor repo find --path repos`
(you can verify if your repositories are registered in
`~/.config/leapp/repos.json`).
