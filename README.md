## Troubleshooting

### Where can I report an issue or RFE related to the framework or other actors?

- GitHub issues are preferred:
  - Leapp framework: [https://github.com/oamg/leapp/issues/new/choose](https://github.com/oamg/leapp/issues/new/choose)
  - Leapp actors: [https://github.com/oamg/leapp-repository/issues/new/choose](https://github.com/oamg/leapp-repository/issues/new/choose)

- When filing an issue, include:
  - Steps to reproduce the issue
  - *All files in /var/log/leapp*
  - */var/lib/leapp/leapp.db*
  - *journalctl*
  - If you want, you can optionally send anything else would you like to provide (e.g. storage info)

**For your convenience you can pack all logs with this command:**

`# tar -czf leapp-logs.tgz /var/log/leapp /var/lib/leapp/leapp.db`

Then you may attach only the `leapp-logs.tgz` file.

### Where can I seek help?
We’ll gladly answer your questions and lead you to through any troubles with the
actor development.

You can reach us at IRC: `#leapp` on freenode.
