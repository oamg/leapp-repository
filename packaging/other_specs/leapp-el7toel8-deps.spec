# NOTE: the Version contains the %{rhel} macro just for the convenience to
# have always upgrade path between newer and older deps packages. So for
# packages built for RHEL 8 it's 5.0.8, for RHEL 9 it's 5.0.9, etc..
# Not sure how much it will be beneficial in the end, but why not?

# TODO: keeping the name of the specfile & srpm leapp-el7toel8-deps even when
# it could be confusing as we start to build for el8toel9.

# we need the dnf configuration manager to check and modify configuration

Requires:   dnf-command(config-manager)

# It should not happen that dracut is not present on the target system,

Requires:   dracut

# Used to determine RHEL version of a given target RHEL installation image -
# uncompressing redhat-release package from the ISO.
Requires:   cpio

# just to be sure that /etc/modprobe.d is present
Requires:   kmod

# required to be able to format disk images with XFS file systems (default)
# NOTE: this is really needed on the source system, but keep it for the target
# one too
Requires:   xfsprogs

# required to be able to format disk images with Ext4 file systems
# NOTE: this is not happening by default, but we can expact that many customers
# will want to / need to do this - especially on RHEL 7 now. Adding this deps
# as the best trade-off to resolve this problem.
# NOTE: this is really needed on the source system, but keep it for the target
