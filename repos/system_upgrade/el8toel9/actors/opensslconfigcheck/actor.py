    The OpenSSL configuration changed between RHEL8 and RHEL9 significantly with the rebase to
    OpenSSL 3.0. There are several things to check:

     * If the file was not modified by user, the RPM will take care of the upgrade
     * The file was modified and for some reason the link to the system-wide crypto
       policies is missing -- this is not recommended so we should warn users about that
     * The new OpenSSL 3.0 is using providers so we need to add them to the configuration
       file to make sure they behave the same way as when the original configuration file
       is used, especially for FIPS mode.
