    Check if VDO devices need to be migrated to lvm management.

    `Background`
    ============
    In RHEL 9.0 the indepdent VDO management software, `vdo manager`, is
    superseded by LVM management.  Existing VDOs must be converted to LVM-based
    management *before* upgrading to RHEL 9.0.

    The `CheckVdo` actor provides a pre-upgrade check for VDO devices that have
    not been converted and, if any are found, produces an inhibitory report
    during upgrade check phase.   If none are found `CheckVdo` does not produce
    a report concerning such VDO devices.

    As there currently exists the theoretical possibility that a VDO device may
    not complete its conversion to LVM-based management (e.g., via a poorly
    timed system crash during the conversion) `CheckVdo` also provides a
    pre-upgrade check for VDO devices in this state.  If any are found
    `CheckVdo` produces an inhibitory report during upgrade check phase.  If
    none are found `CheckVdo` does not produce a report concerning such VDO
    devices.

    If the VdoConversionInfo model indicates unexpected errors occurred during
    scanning CheckVdo will produce appropriate inhibitory reports.

    Lastly, if the VdoConversionInfo model indicates conditions exist where VDO
    devices could exist but the necessary software to check was not installed
    on the system CheckVdo will present a dialog to the user. This dialog will
    ask the user to either install the required software if the user knows or
    is unsure that VDO devices exist or to approve the continuation of the
    upgrade if the user is certain that no VDO devices exist.
