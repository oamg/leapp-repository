    # to say whether they should be run from the chrooted sys or outside
    # - just from the initamfs. This is specific really just for actors that
    # will be processed during the "offline" phases. From this point, maybe
    # function in a common library would be fine to help with that. But it's
    # probably not so easy to decide & realize how we will resolve that. Let's
    # keep that for discussion
