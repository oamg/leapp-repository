    Inhibits upgrade if SystemdServicesTasks tasks are in conflict

    There is possibility, that SystemdServicesTasks messages with conflicting
    requested service states could be produced. For example a service is
    requested to be both enabled and disabled. This actor inhibits upgrade in
    such cases.

    Note: We expect that SystemdServicesTasks could be produced even after the
    TargetTransactionChecksPhase (e.g. during the ApplicationPhase). The
    purpose of this actor is to report collisions in case we can already detect
    them. In case of conflicts caused by produced messages later we just log
    the collisions and the services will end up disabled.
