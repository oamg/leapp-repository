the needed space based on size of each FS. I have been thinking to lower

    Context manager that prepares the source system overlay and yields the mount.

    The in-place upgrade itself requires to do some changes on the system to be
    able to perform the in-place upgrade itself - or even to be able to evaluate
    if the system is possible to upgrade. However, we do not want to (and must not)
    change the original system until we pass beyond the point of not return.

    For that purposes we have to create a layer above the real host file system,
    where we can safely perform all operations without affecting the system
    setup, rpm database, etc. Currently overlay (OVL) technology showed it is
    capable to handle our requirements good enough - with some limitations.

    This function prepares a disk image and an overlay layer for each
    mountpoint configured in /etc/fstab, excluding those with FS type noted
    in the OVERLAY_DO_NOT_MOUNT set. Such prepared OVL images are then composed
    together to reflect the real host filesystem. In the end everything is cleaned.

    The new solution can be now problematic for system with too many partitions
    and loop devices. For such systems we keep for now the possibility of the
    fallback to an old solution, which has however number of issues that are
    fixed by the new design. To fallback to the old solution, set envar:
        LEAPP_OVL_LEGACY=1

    Disk images created for OVL are formatted with XFS by default. In case of
    problems, it's possible to switch to Ext4 FS using:
        LEAPP_OVL_IMG_FS_EXT4=1
