Tutorials
=========

Tutorials here are focused on In-Place Upgrades with leapp repositories
covered by the `leapp-repository <https://github.com/oamg/leapp-repository>`_ project.
Therefore the main focus of these tutorials is to provide information how to
write leapp actors for **In-Place Upgrades (IPU)** with the leapp framework.

.. note::
    These tutorials are under reconstruction and we will be glad for a feedback.
    Feel free to contact us via `GH discussion <https://github.com/oamg/leapp-repository/discussions>`_
    in our upstream project.
