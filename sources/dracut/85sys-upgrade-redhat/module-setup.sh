    # NOTE: keep it for now
    # RPM hash/sig checks (via NSS) don't work without these
    #inst_libdir_file "libfreebl*" "libsqlite*" "libsoftokn*"

    # NOTE: do we need that? I guess that not as we will not use rpm like that
    # RPM can't find the rpmdb without rpmconfig

    # !! NOTE !!
    # we need to put here much more energy later as it will be much reliable
    # to keep everything pre-pivot. Even the leapp itself should be ideally
    # part of the initramfs and we should install there all deps to be sure
    # we will not be *ucked up by missing/changed libraries during the upgrade.
    # As we discussed with gazdown, maybe we should keep that on actors itself
    # to say whether they should be run from the chrooted sys or outside
    # - just from the initamfs. This is specific really just for actors that
    # will be processed during the "offline" phases. From this point, maybe
    # function in a common library would be fine to help with that. But it's
    # probably not so easy to decide & realize how we will resolve that. Let's
    # keep that for discussion
    # Q: Would we hack that in way of copy whole initramfs into the root, mount
    #    mount it and set envars

    # install this one to ensure we are able to sync write
    inst_binary sync

    # script to actually run the upgrader binary
    inst_hook upgrade 50 "$moddir/do-upgrade.sh"

    #NOTE: some clean up?.. ideally, everything should be inside the leapp*
    #NOTE: current *.service is changed so in case we would like to use the
    #      hook, we will have to modify it back
    # it is always fine to have separate logs
